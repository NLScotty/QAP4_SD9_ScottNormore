Project 1 includes the two python programs. Program1 is the python program that processes invoices for Ons Stop Insurance. Program2 is the python program that creates a line graph of the sales in respect to the month of the year. It will not display months that have not happened if the year is not complete.\

Project 4 contains the javascript component. It contains an index file which the javascript file is linked to. The javascript file contains a customer object that is printed to the html file.}
